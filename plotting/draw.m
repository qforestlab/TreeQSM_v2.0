function draw(radius,length,axis,start_point,varargin)
% Draw a branch (cylinder). The additional arguments in
% varargin are passed to the cylinder-command which computes
% points for a unit cylinder. The first argument is assumed
% to be the number of points to be used in the circles of
% the cylinder. The second is a generator curve which is
% used for the profile of the cylinder. For more details
% about these arguments SEE CYLINDER.

% Pass arguments to the cylinder-command.
if nargin == 6
    [x y z] = cylinder(1,varargin{2});
elseif nargin == 7

% corresponding parameters of the branch.

% Axis of the unit cylinder.

% Compute rotation axis and normalize it.

    raxis = [1 0 0];
end

% Compute rotation angle.
angle = acos(dot(u,axis)/norm(axis));

% Store size of the cylinder points for later reshaping.
s = size(x);

% Vercat point matrices for faster computations. Multiply
% with the rotation matrix.

% branch.
